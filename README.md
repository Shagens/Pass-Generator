# Pass-Generator

# User Story
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

# 
I've created a password generator, that when the site comes up, it allows the user to choose a password length between 8-128.
The user will also be able to choose whether they want lowercase, uppercase, numbers or symbols.
When the user has gone through all the prompts, a password is generated upon requested criteria.
